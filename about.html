      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
      LCAFE Esports is a youth-focused initiative dedicated to unlocking gaming potential in township communities.
      Currently operating as a pop-up esports company hosting tournments at selected schools and malls,
      with a long-term vision to establish a permanent space at the nearest mall.
      Our mission is to create safe, inclusive, and exciting spaces where young people can engage in esports, 
      discover new digital skills, and pursue opportunities in competitive gaming and web development.
      </p>
      <p>
      We aim to introduce esports to primary and high schools, fostering talent from an early age. 
      Through tournaments, workshops, and mentorship, we empower the next generation of players, creators, and tech innovators.
